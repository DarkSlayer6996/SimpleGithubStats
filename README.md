## How does it work?
It uses Github API to get all data. To avoid being rate-limited it has a simple cache that gets updated when it haven't been checked for a time that you can select in settings

## Suggestions/Bugs
Before opening any issue install latest edgy and if it still has that problem, open an issue so I can fix it as soon as possible

## Notes
- Min API 22 (Android 5.1)
- App has an auto-updater, you can disable it in settings
